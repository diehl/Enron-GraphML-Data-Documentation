GraphML Representation of the Enron Email Dataset - Version 0.1

Overview
========

This dataset contains a representation of the Enron email dataset derived from 
the MySQL representations previously released by USC/ISI [1] and UC Berkeley [2].
In addition, it contains ground truth about a set of manager-subordinate 
relationships within the company that existed between January 2000 and November
2001 [3]. This ground truth data was the basis for the experiments on social
relationship identification conducted in [4]. 

Data Description
================

Email Message Data

The email message data is derived from the messages, addresses and recipients tables
in the UC Berkeley MySQL database. The UC Berkeley data was selected over the USC/ISI
data due to its completeness. Both datasets have been conditioned in some unknown
manner by these institutions. After inspecting both, it became clear that the UC 
Berkeley dataset contains more dimensions of the original data.

The GraphML representation of the messages captures much of the information associated with
a given message using Email Address and Message nodes. The attributes of each node type
are described below.

Email Address Node
------------------
address         - [String] The email address represented by the node.
fullyObserved   - [Boolean] According to the USC/ISI data, the Enron email dataset represents 
                  the union of the inboxes of 151 employees. The addresses of those employees 
                  are listed in the employeelist table in the USC/ISI MySQL database. 
type            - [String] "Email Address"

Message Node
------------
datetime        - [String] The datetime associated with the message in UTC. 
epochSecs       - [Integer] The datetime represented as seconds from the epoch.
subject         - [String] The subject of the message.
body            - [String] The body of the message.
emailID         - [String] The email message ID from the message header. 
type            - [String] "Message"

Senders and recipients of the message are captured by SENT and RECEIVED_BY relationships.
The attributes of each relationship type are described below.

SENT Relationship
-----------------
datetime        - [String] The datetime associated with the message in UTC. 
epochSecs       - [Integer] The datetime represented as seconds from the epoch.

RECEIVED_BY Relationship
------------------------
datetime        - [String] The datetime associated with the message in UTC. 
epochSecs       - [Integer] The datetime represented as seconds from the epoch.
type            - [String] "to" / "cc" / "bcc"
order           - [Integer] The position of the recipient address in the list of addresses
                  with the specified type. 
                  
The datetime and epochSecs fields in the SENT and RECEIVED_BY relationships are identical 
to those of the Message nodes that they are connected to. 

The employees for which manager-subordinate relationship ground truth is available are 
represented by Person nodes. The attributes of a Person node are described below.

Person Node
-----------
lastName        - [String] The individual's last name.
firstName       - [String] The individual's first name.
provenance      - [String] The source containing evidence of the individual's existence. 
type            - [String] "Person"

Manager-subordinate social relationships between individuals are represented by 
DIRECTLY_REPORTED_TO relationships in GraphML. An individual's use of an email address is
captured by USED_EMAIL_ADDRESS relationships. The attributes of these relationships are 
described below.

DIRECTLY_REPORTED_TO Relationship
---------------------------------
startTime       - [String] Datetime for the beginning of the interval over which the 
                  relationship is known to exist.
endTime         - [String] Datetime for the end of the interval over which the relationship
                  is known to exist.
evidenceType    - [String] "Interval". If the evidence were derived from an email, for example,
                  the evidence type would often be point evidence since most messages do not
                  provide evidence of the extent of the relationship.
provenance      - [String] The source containing evidence of the relationship's existence.
type            - [String] "Social Relationship"

USED_EMAIL_ADDRESS Relationship
-------------------------------
No attributes
